## Scalar Field

## Vector Field

## Mesh

## PDE

# Boundary Conditions

## PDE Solver (FD)

### Descritization methods
FD: Finite Differences
(FVM could be implemented in the future)

### Linear/Numerical Solvers
ADI: Alternating Direction Implicit
LU: Direct LU Decomposition

### Spatial Schemes (for derivative approximation)
Central Differences
Upwind Scheme

### ???  (FOR FD ONLY)
Vertex centered 
(cell centered won't be implemented for FD, only for FVM)
